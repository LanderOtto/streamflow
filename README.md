# StreamFlow

The StreamFlow framework is a container-native *Workflow Management System (WMS)* written in Python 3.
It has been designed around two main principles:
* Allow the execution of tasks in **multi-container environments**, in order to support concurrent execution
of multiple communicating tasks in a multi-agent ecosystem.
* Relax the requirement of a single shared data space, in order to allow for **hybrid workflow** executions on top of
multi-cloud or hybrid cloud/HPC infrastructures.
